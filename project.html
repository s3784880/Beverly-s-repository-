        <h3 style="font-family:Cochin;"> Overview </h3>
        <p>This project is about changing the real estate industry by introducing an easily-accessible VR tool to business and consumers by conducting virtual reality home tours. I aspire to create an interactive interface where someone is able to virtually explore their house through a VR headset before it has even been built. This interactive interface includes consumers being able to walk around their true-to-scaled house, toggle furniture and more.</p>

        <h3 style="font-family:Cochin;"> Motivation </h3>
        <p>My motivation for this project arises from this problem- home buyers, despite spending their life savings on new homes, are generally blind to the actual scale and result of their new home. Being able to experience an accurately scaled virtual tour of your home could make or break a consumer’s decision. VR in real estate does exist, but I have personally yet to see widespread consumer accessibility of it. I want to form an approachable team that is capable of developing authentic homes in virtual reality for the use of home-buyers wanting a vision for their builds as well as seller’s that want to upscale their services and give customers a more memorable experience.</p>

        <h3 style="font-family:Cochin;"> Description </h3>
        <p>This project is centered around modeling a consumer friendly computerised home that can be toured through virtual reality (as well as though a desktop). This virtual build will be modeled after a real-life floor plan and upon entering will feel true-to-size and correctly scaled. I will discuss plans for multiple features, but the focus of the project will be strongly on design, detail and scale.</p>
        <p>The first major feature I would like to include is the ability to change furniture with the switch of a button. For instance, being able to change the shape, colour, or size of the dining table by clicking the button besides it. This can range for all pieces of furniture in the house. Although, depending on which third party application the group agrees to upload the virtual space to, there may be some limitations. Such as an excessive amount of furniture, causing the server to become laggy, interrupting virtual tours and causing an overall uncomfortable and negative experience for the customer. In order to fully optimise this virtual space, we must choose which pieces of furniture can and cannot be modified. </p>
        <p>Model resources are something that will be commonly sought upon when trying to develop this home model, if not modeled by oneself, assets such as beds, tables, stovetops, and others must be outsourced. There are many free architectural resources on the internet, but the main websites we will be utilizing are Free3D, PlanetVR, Booth, Deviantart, and the Unity Asset Store. To avoid the usage of pirated/stolen assets, we must constantly verify the validity of used assets and source the original creators. The same rules apply for texture packs.</p>
        <p>Once the actual house model is completed, I want to implement four different modes that the consumer can view in- floor plan, empty, furnished, and birds-eye mode. The first mode, ‘floor plan mode’, is simply the architectural floor plan of the home layed on the ground at one's feet, but blown up to the size of a real building. This means that there are no walls or furniture, and the user is able to freely walk in any direction they like within the premises. The second mode is ‘empty mode’, empty mode is where the user tours the virtual space with all furniture toggled off. This leaves simply the walls, doors, sinks and toilets to explore. ‘Furniture mode’ proves the customer with the most immersive experience, as stated multiple times before, this will include a fully furnished, customisable, interactive space for the user to delve into and have a good feel for. This mode will possibly be the closest to what they will experience in their future household. Lastly, ‘birds-eye’ mode is simply viewing ‘Furniture mode’ from above, this will be done by removing the roof and installing an invisible wall above so the user can freely explore what it’s like from above. </p>
        <p>I highly suggest that these home models will be uploaded on a virtual space such as ChilloutVR or VRchat. This makes the models easily accessible for team members with and without a VR headset. Furthermore, the practicality of using ChilloutVR/VRchat is great, for instance- the communication mode is set to proximity chat, simulating real-life building sites. Group members can also use their unfinished virtual houses as meeting spaces, giving spark to inspiration among each other. </p>

        <h3 style="font-family:Cochin;"> Technologies </h3>
        <p>Obviously, to make a house tour in VR, at least one member is required to have a headset. Fortunately, I own an Oculus Quest 2, but having more members that have VR would make build-testing much more efficient. Other equipment needed is a laptop or computer capable enough to operate high-processing programs such as Blender and Unity. The program Blender is needed for model-making and Unity is a useful tool for adding texture and lighting to models. In order to enter these virtual house models through VR, I suggest that uploading these house models to a virtual platform such a ChilloutVR or VRchat would make the house model extremely accessible to group members with and without VR.</p>

        <h3 style="font-family:Cochin;"> Skills Required </h3>
        <p>The most valuable skills for this project is diligence, patience, and persistence. There isn't much technical skill required to participate in such a project. It would be useful if group members have experience or are capable of using Blender, Unity, or any similar application. Although these programs can be easily learnt through YouTube, forums, or eachother. By the end of the project period, group members should be able to create and model houses on blender, as well as create custom furniture from the tools provided. Furthermore, they should be capable of uploading these models onto third party applications where it can be accessed by consumers. </p>

        <h3 style="font-family:Cochin;"> Outcome </h3>
        <p>My original problem was that “home buyers, despite spending their life savings on new homes, are generally blind to the actual scale and result of their new home”. With the use of VR technology, home buyers can finally get a vision of the home they are buying, offering 
            not only a virtual scale of their houses, but an option to add furniture and other options to their house. In the success of this project, group members will present at least one fully furnished, customisable, true to scale, house model available to the consumer (in this case, the public). 
            By using this incredible virtual reality technology to its fullest, we are a step forward to a more technological future. Furthermore, normalising the use of virtual reality will greatly improve society since it has the capability to benefit almost every field it's applied to. </p>
