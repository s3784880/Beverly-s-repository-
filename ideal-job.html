        <p>The webpage shown above lists a job vacancy as a User Experience and User Interface Product Designer for Firefly Education. Firefly Education is an educational publishing institute that is passionate about the art of teaching and provides learning resources to primary students, secondary students and teachers. They are currently searching for mid-level workers to assist in developing complex web applications that are easily understood by a young audience whilst also being sophisticated enough for mature adults.</p>
        <p>I've always had an eye for creativity and aesthetics, website and user interface design is something that I gravitate towards subconsciously. Furthermore, being a young adult that is also knowledgeable in youth-catered media, such as cartoons and video games, I believe that I would be able to find a perfect balance between an adult and child friendly website. </p>
        <p>The practical skills and qualifications needed are 2-3 years of experience as a UX/UI designer, ability to work with CSS and HTML, and mastery in Adobe Creative Cloud. Other skills required is a high level of creativity, the capability to work on multiple projects, the effort to stay up to date with the most recent UI trends/techniques/technologies, and a significant attention to detail. </p>

        <p>From the technical skills listed above, I believe that I have some knowledge on both capability to work with CSS/HTML and competency in using applications from the Adobe Creative Cloud. Other general skills such as multitasking and creativity are qualities that I've been practicing throughout my education which will later carry onto my work ethic. Unfortunately, I do not keep up with the latest UI trends/techniques/technologies nor do I have years of experience. </p>

        <p>There are many ways in which I can obtain these skills, qualifications and experience required for this position. First, it’d be to enrich myself on the methodology of CSS and HTML possibly though university, an external institute, or self-taught using free online programs and YouTube. To practice using programs such as Photoshop, and Illustrator, I plan to use them for my future personal art projects so I can hone my skills as well as have fun.
        In order to get experience in the workforce, I will attempt to apply for lower-class projects that focus on a lot of teamwork- I find that learning from others is extremely valuable. After compiling my projects (as well as mock designs) into a portfolio and raising my credibility as a UI designer, I will be able to apply for this job as a UX/UI Product Designer. When invested in the industry, I believe that it’d be much easier to keep in touch with the most recent UX/UI trends and techniques, I could even innovate and develop my own. </p>
