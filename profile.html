        <h3 style="font-family:Cochin;"> Myers-Briggs Test </h3>
        <p>I am an ISFJ-T, also referred to as the Defender in the Myers-Briggs test. According to the 16Personalities website, Defenders are individuals with the Introverted, Observant, Feeling and Judging personality types. Contrary to this, I would consider myself more so an Ambivert since my introvert-to-extrovert ratio is almost 50/50.
            My supposed strengths are that I am- supportive, reliable, patient, observant, enthusiastic and practical. Weaknesses consist of being humble, shy, repressing feelings, overwhelming oneself and being reluctant to change. </p>

        <h3 style="font-family:Cochin;">VARK Questionare</h3>
        <p> My score for the online learning style test is shown below in the table. These results were taken from The VARK Questionnaire.</p>
        <div class=vark><img src="VARK.jpg" alt="vark"></div>
        <p>These results show that I am a Kinesthetic learner, which assumes that I typically learn best in instances where I am able to physically apply my knowledge in hands-on activities. It is suggested that people with the Kinesthetic learning style should use case studies demonstrating situations to best solve a problem. Furthermore, reading, writing and auditory learning methods are my weakest points.</p>

        <h3 style="font-family:Cochin;"> Big Five Personality Test </h3>
        <p>Below are the results for the quiz i partook called the Big Five Personality test.</p>

        <div class=big-five><img src="big-five.jpg" alt="bigfive"></div>
        <p>I scored highest in the third and fourth factor, being Agreeableness and Conscientiousness, and lowest in Intellect/Imagination. Factor four, being my highest, is labeled as being careful and diligent, furthermore, high scores in factor three express that the individual is friendly and optimistic. </p>

        <h3 style="font-family:Cochin;"> Overall... </h3>
        <p> To sum up the results mentioned above, I am an ISFJ-T personality type whose dominant education style is hands on, kinesthetic learning and I possess characteristics resembling the likes of being observant, patient, diligent, and enthusiastic. </p>
        <p>According to the Myers-Briggs test, the personality types I am most compatible with are ESFJ, ISFP, ISTJ. I guess I should try to match with people who are the same or one of the personality types listed previously. Results from the second test suggest that I should attempt to find people who read, write and learn auditorily to a greater extent than I do, and I should find others who lack in the kinesthetic aspect. Filling in for each other's weaknesses will strengthen a group. 
            I think that these results suggest that I will take a supporting role in the group, assisting and reinforcing others with their tasks. Although this may cause me to take on too many tasks that I’m able to maintain and overwhelm myself, to avoid this I need to work on knowing my limits with myself and the extent that I am able to assist others.</p>

        <p>Despite everything stated above, one’s personality and compatibility with another is too complex to be simply labeled and categorised to a few simple explanations. These results should be taken with a grain of salt and only serve as a guide- not a method to dictate who one should and shouldn’t work with. </p>
