        <h3 style="font-family:Cochin;"> What is your interest in IT? </h3>
        <p>In an academic context, I find great enjoyment in programming and writing script. I’ve taken several classes that require the ability to problem solve by creating or utilizing code and there was never a dull moment in doing so.
        Besides that, I take great interest in Virtual Reality and I truly believe that it is the stepping stone of future technological advancements. I believe VR will soon be used as a mainstream learning and industrial tool, especially in the medical industry. </p>

        <h3 style="font-family:Cochin;"> When did your interest in IT start? </h3>
        <p>For as long as I remember, I’ve always had a great interest in entertainment media and technology such as Nintendo and XBOX consoles. I grew up loving the Pokemon franchise and still stay very faithful to the company at present. As I grew older, I began exploring more technology related mediums, such as Virtual Reality and concepts such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. </p>

        <h3 style="font-family:Cochin;"> Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? </h3>
        <p>I honestly cannot recall a time where I did not show interest in progressing information technology. I recall constantly clinging very close to my cousin, who is 4 years older than me. He always had current technology and was the gateway to my admiration for electronics.</p>

        <h3 style="font-family:Cochin;"> Outline your IT experience (if any) </h3>
        <p>I’ve excelled in the RMIT courses ‘Introduction to Programming’ and ‘Programming Fundamentals for Scientists’. I’m adequate with the programming languages Java and Python and am competent in utilizing software such as MATLAB, SPYDER, Unity, Blender, and more. </p>

        <h3 style="font-family:Cochin;"> Why did you choose to come to RMIT? </h3>
        <p>I chose to go to RMIT because I fell in love with the campus on open-day in 2018. As well as that, I contacted some current RMIT students regarding their experience and they complemented the university’s focus on practical, hands-on learning which struck my eye.

        <h3 style="font-family:Cochin;"> What do you expect to learn during your studies? </h3>
        <p>In this Introduction to Information Technology class, I expect to be enlightened on topics such as networking, security and data. This is also an opportunity to learn independently and from others through the group project. Through the project portion of the course, I hope to possibly learn about website/app and user interface design, and hopefully have the opportunity to become adequate in the programming language C#.</p>
